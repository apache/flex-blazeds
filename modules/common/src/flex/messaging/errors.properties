# IMPORTANT: Error messages are now split between two files in BlazeDS and LCDS.
# This file is for BlazeDS error messages (which can be used by LCDS code as well).
# LCDS only messages now live in a separate file in the LCDS branch. While editing
# these files, keep in mind that both files are part of the same numeric sequence.
#
# Error and details messages for LocalizedMessageExceptions are stored in the following format:
# Error message: {number}[-{variant}]={message}
# Details message: {number}[-{variant}]-details={details}
#
# Server error numbers start at 10000.
#
# Error numbers are chosen by taking the next available value in a numeric sequence.
# Each functional component or group of components should claim a unique block of 50
# numbers to use for error and details messages. If this initial set of 50 values
# are exhausted, the component should claim the next available block of 50 values for
# its use. This means that an error-ridden component may well use a disjoint set of
# error numbers. Here's an example:
# Feature        Error numbers claimed
# -----------------------------------
# Security      10050-10099
# Configuration 10100-10149
# Security      10150-10199 <- Security exhausted its first block, so it claims the next
#                              available block of 50 values for its continued use.
#
# Constants to lookup error/details strings by 'number', and optional 'variant',
# should be defined in the classes that use them. When a class needs to define a new
# error and/or details string, add the necessary string(s) to this file using the next
# available numeric value in the corresponding range.
#
# The structure of this file should be maintained according to increasing error number. This
# means that for features that throw many errors, blocks of corresponding message strings
# won't necessarily be contiguous, but this simplifies identifying the starting value for
# the next available block of values and simplifies validation that duplicate error numbers
# are not being used.
# * Caution: Reusing a property key doesn't generate any error, so watch for typos.
#            The last defined property with a duplicate key clobbers the earlier values.
